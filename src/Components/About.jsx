        <div className=''> <h1>I’m Chaithanya, a UX Designer and Web Developer with a passion for crafting engaging and impactful digital experiences. My journey began with web development, but I quickly became fascinated by the ‘Why’ behind user interactions. This curiosity led me to explore UX design, where I discovered my passion for solving complex problems through intuitive and User Centered solutions.
            <br />
            While my official title has been UX Engineer, I see myself as a Design-Engineer Hybrid. I’m passionate about bridging the gap between design and development, capable of taking projects from initial research through to final deployment. My expertise includes tools like React.js, Tailwind CSS, Three.js, and Figma for design, and I’m particularly drawn to creating immersive and interactive experiences using GSAP, Locomotive Scroll, and Swiper JS.
            <br />
            My educational journey at Woxsen University and hands-on experience with diverse projects have shaped my approach to innovation, collaboration, and problem-solving. I am excited to take on new challenges that push boundaries and allow me to create meaningful and impactful user experiences.</h1></div>
